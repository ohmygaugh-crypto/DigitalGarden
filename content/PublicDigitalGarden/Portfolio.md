	Eager to be able to do ETL on the latest data warehouses for my personal fullstack application projects, I've completed these two tutorials:
		[[Talk to your data with an LLM on Snowflake]]
		[[GRANDstack Citibike Tutorial Dashboard]] #neo4j

[[My Obsidian Plugin(s)]]
	I wanted to start contributing to a vibrant developer community and to an app I utilize as a daily driver in my life.
	The "day in the life" Plugin I'm still waiting for approval for from the Pull request. Is a whimsical yet blunt calendar aimed to help your productivity. It will certainly need performance upgrades and refinement in the coming months. I just wanted to ship this MVP to get the idea out in the open.

	I am still a n00b, but it always grinds my gears that I hadn't made much of an effort beyond being hygienic with my digital practices. I actually feel I need to be able to be a threat in the digital realm of life. I feel that is the only way to truly know how to protect yourself besides being obnoxiously paranoid. It's a skillset that will only become of greater importance in the future, perhaps even more so than personal financial management. People need to know how to safe-keep their personal data and understand how to navigate the threat landscape they subject themselves to based on their habitual life practices. (always ethically practiced of course).

	-I am using quartz4 by @jackyzhao to host what you see here. Originally I was hosting this on quartz3 a month ago, but apparently he was improving the src code at the same time I was just getting started with it. No matter. We are here now.
	The reason for this is to: "work with the garage door open"
