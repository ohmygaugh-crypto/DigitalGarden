	Eager to be able to do ETL on the latest data warehouses for my personal fullstack application projects, I've completed these two tutorials:
		[[Talk to your data with an LLM on Snowflake]]

[[My Obsidian Plugin(s)]]
	I wanted to start contributing to a vibrant developer community and to an app I utilize as a daily driver in my life.
	The "day in the life" Plugin I'm still waiting for approval for from the Pull request. Is a whimsical yet blunt calendar aimed to help your productivity. It will certainly need performance upgrades and refinement in the coming months. I just wanted to ship this MVP to get the idea out in the open.

	I am still a n00b, but it always grinds my gears that I hadn't made much of an effort beyond being hygienic with my digital practices. I actually feel I need to be able to be a threat in the digital realm of life. I feel that is the only way to truly know how to protect yourself besides being obnoxiously paranoid. It's a skillset that will only become of greater importance in the future, perhaps even more so than personal financial management. People need to know how to safe-keep their personal data and understand how to navigate the threat landscape they subject themselves to based on their habitual life practices. (always ethically practiced of course).

	-I am using quartz4 by @jackyzhao to host what you see here. Originally I was hosting this on quartz3 a month ago, but apparently he was improving the src code at the same time I was just getting started with it. No matter. We are here now.
	The reason for this is to: "work with the garage door open" 

[[Product Case Studies]]
	Anthroware was such a tremendous place to learn and earn. The culture was everything I dreamed a boutique software firm would feel but better. They had great process the cultivated personal growth. It was the first time I had seen an expectations matrix. I real career growth progress checklist. I don't want to get too corny about it, but everyone was a class act and the mentorship was incredible from every department. Very happy to celebrate their 10 year anniversary with the gang.
	It was there where I worked on this things with my time, but committed the ultimate sin against our core methodologies of being a: "Yes" man.
	Tangibles:
		-Main Quest (Temp Staffing) Digital transformation as a product strategist
			-Dovetail keyword analysis on SME + Stakeholder calls
			-Constant wire frame and design value stream mapping
			-removing blockages between engineering and design. 
		-Side quest Establish a version control PKM for the teams external marketing efforts establish a topical authority map & internal SOP playbook for teammates and new hires to jog their memories of best practices to follow like a battle tested checklist that can handle ambiguous scenarios when the optics are adjusted.
		-Side quest website rebuild to cater towards new divisional effort in (competitive intelligence)= Win/Research Consulting.
			-established a partnership with a leading company in the space that we would be able to leverage their SaaS product during engagements
			-Assisted in design material efforts in figma to complete deck with a movie tech company. 
		- Advised two startups:
			- One medical advertisement related: Had some ways to go fleshing out their idea. And Product viability.
			- One public funding related: Really exciting project using AI. Made a proof of concept for the founder for her to demo on demo day.
	Intangibles:
	learned the "Anthroware way" culturally and in professional practice:
	I got to see how a boutique software firm originates from the ground up. How it was afloat 10 years down the line because of the type of leadership and culture and process that were put in place.
		Here's the key takeaways that will help my career:
		Take the job that's going to pay you 1/3 the price of a consultant but you get to be the directors right hand man(apprentice) and see how the clockwork is and how to surf the waves of responsibility the arise from clientele deliverable cadence. what the expectations are the the softskills to get the client cozier.
		I got payed to be a sponge. And work on the top 1% of problems that the leadership was able to bring to the table.
		I got to learn by assisting the director(s) of:
		Engineering: Harrison
		Product: Logan
		CEO: Jon
	I'm still rather unpolished. I got a great intro to what I'll get my hands on as a consultant. It's just that consultant work didn't come in after 8 months and Anthroware as a collective has to hedge runway risk lightening the load of an over leveraged asset for non existent product work. 
	I got to review outcomes of old value flow & dot voting workshops. Dedicated time doing in SME workshop keyword analysis. (data driven rationale to showcase in case study visual aid like we did in winloss for Salesloft)
	I think the biggest thing Anthroware lacked was someone cleaning up the design clutter sweeping behind design. Thus having it more obvious what engineering was to have each button, modal and gizmo on within the app and how it was all interrelated. On top of that it was difficult to prioritize backlog on clickup because the way we categorized everything was in a state of flux because we had no set filter out process outside bickering in the scrums.
