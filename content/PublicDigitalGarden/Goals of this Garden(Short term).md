A rabbit hole for my curious mind.

# Enhance understanding of:

[[Data Science]] literally using chatGPT to NLP back to SQL and crushing the game along the way. This co-pilot pair programming will render the barrier to entry way less for data scientists and enhance the productivity of existing scientists to jump to the tippy top of their flow state plateau and acheive more through duration rather than the need to break new ground intelligence wise before working. 

It's just about asking the right questions. Qhich any one can do and already smart people will still have an edge, just that their mental model of SQL is no longer as great of an attribute, it's more subtle, still important for efficiency, just more subtle of a job security trait to come to terms with like everything else AI removes from our hands.

[[Hacking]] and what attack vectors I like outlined as a process.
- interrelation between toolchains and the step by step blueprint of: enumeration, foothold and flag capture
- a toolbox for being competitive on hack the box for the sport of it!
