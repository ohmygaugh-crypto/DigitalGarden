Data Science / Data pipeline repeatable process outlined

- Great Useful Queries
- literally using chatGPT to to NLP to SQL and crushing the game that way will render the barrier to entry way less for data scientists. then it's just about asking the right questions. which any one can do and already smart people will still have an edge, just that their mental model of SQL is no longer as great of an attribute, it's more subtle, still important for efficiency, just more subtle of a job security trait.

Hacking and what attack vectors I like outlined as a process.
- interrelation between toolchains and the step by step blueprint of: enumeration, foothold and flag capture
- a toolbox for being competitive on hack the box for the sport of it!

abstract:
I mean I can only be so good as a human am I right? Why would I spend time on this tedious endeavor rather than perfecting my craft within a metaGPT assembly line desired outcome generated through . It's analytical, adaptable, perfectly focused why would't I do all the concept outlined above in a multiagent I/O application that could grant me my application output needs at the cost of a few dollars where the opportunity cost to learn, memorize, and regurgitate repeatable myself would quite literally be in the thousands of dollars to compete with?
